# About the Project
Feedo is an innovative project aimed at safeguarding crops against birds and animals using modern technology. By integrating Arduino, motion sensors, GSM modules, and the Feedo mobile application, this system provides real-time monitoring and reporting capabilities to farmers, enabling them to protect their crops efficiently.

# Features
1. Motion Detection: Feedo utilizes motion sensors to detect the presence of birds and animals in the vicinity of crops.
2. Real-time Alerts: Upon detecting motion, the system triggers real-time alerts to notify the farmer of potential threats to the crops.
3. GSM Communication: Feedo employs GSM modules to send alerts and reports directly to the farmer's mobile device, ensuring instant communication and timely response.
4. Data Logging: The system logs data regarding motion detection events, allowing farmers to analyze patterns and trends in crop protection.
5. Feedo Mobile App: The Feedo mobile application serves as an interface for farmers to receive alerts, view reports, and manage the crop protection system remotely.
6. User-Friendly Interface: With an easy-to-understand interface, farmers can effortlessly navigate the Feedo app and access essential information about their crops' security status.

# Development
This app is completely developed by using FlutterFlow & Firebase.
